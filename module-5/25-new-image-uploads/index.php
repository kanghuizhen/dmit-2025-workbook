<!-- 

PROGRAM SPECS & FLOW: We're going to create a small website that has just two pages:

1. index.php: this is where the user will be given a form that prompts them to upload an image, along with a title and description. When the user submits the form, it will create two versions of the image (a 256x256 square thumbnail that retains the original aspect ratio and a 720p full version of the image).

2. gallery.php: this will fetch the thumbnails for each image and allow the user to view a larger version of each.

Our project directory will look like this:

/22-image-uploads
    /images
        /full
        /thumbs
    index.php
    gallery.php
    upload.php

... but the images/ folder and everything inside will only exist on the server.

We will also need a table (see `init.sql`) in order to store some metadata for each image.

<?php
$page_title = "Upload Image Files";
include "include/header.php";
?>
<form action="<?= htmlspecialchars($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']) ?>" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">


</form>

<?php
include "include/footer.php";
?>
