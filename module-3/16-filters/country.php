    SQL INJECTIONS

    Due to the way that SQL is structured, it's easy for users to slip in an arbitrary statement with their inputs. This is why we need to use prepared statements and sanitise our values.

    Let's say we have a sign up / registration form. For the name, our user gives us the following: 

        Valerie'); DROP TABLE customers; --

    If we don't use prepared statements, the application's query might look something like this: 

        INSERT INTO customers (name, email username, password) VALUES ($name, $email, $username, $password);

    If we let things run as they are, this is what would happen:

        INSERT INTO customers (name, email username, password) VALUES ('Valerie'); DROP TABLE customers; --'
    */

    // First, we're checking to see if the connection is good. We are 'preparing' our statement. 
    if ($statement = $connection->prepare($query)) { 

        // Next, we need to tell MySQL what data type (integer, in this case) we are using and which parameter (value) to bind to our earlier 'template'.
        $statement->bind_param("i", $rank);

        // Now, we get to actually run it ... 
        $statement->execute();

        // ... and fetch the results.
        $result = $statement->get_result();

        if ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
            echo "<h2 class=\"display-4 mb-3\">" . $row['country'] . " Statistics</h2>";

        } else {
            echo "<p>No data found for the selected country.</p>";
        }

        // When we're finished, we can release the data and free up server resources.
