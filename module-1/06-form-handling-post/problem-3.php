/*
    ### Problem 3: Vowel Counter

    Write a program that takes a string input from the user and counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in it.


    #### Bonus Question

    Some English words do not have any of the standard vowels (a, e, i, o, u), but do have a 'y' (ex. any, why, my, sky ...).

    Extend your program so that it looks for each word that contains no standard vowel, counts every 'y' in that word, and prints the total number vowels with 'y' words added. 
*/

// This is the syntax for our ternary shorthand: 
// $variable = condition ? if true : else false;

$user_text = isset($_POST['user-text']) ? $_POST['user-text'] : '';
$standard_count = 0;
$y_count = 0;

if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
    // Our first step is normalisation. We'll convert everything to lowercase so that our script doesn't discriminate between cases (ex. e and E, or a and A).
    $text = mb_strtolower(trim($user_text), 'UTF-8'); // trim() removes leading and trailing whitespace.

    // str_split() -> converts each character in a string to an item within a simple indexed array.
    $char_array = str_split($text);
    $vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'];

    foreach ($char_array as $char) {
        // in_array() -> looks for a needle (a value) in a haystack (an array). In this case, we are checking to see whether or not every single character in our user-provided phrase is a vowel or not (i.e. if it's in our vowel list).
        if (in_array($char, $vowels, TRUE)) {
            // If the character in question is a vowel, we'll increase our vowel counter.
            $standard_count++;
        }
    }

     * Okay, great -- we've got our vowel count! Now, we've got to figure out the number of y-words. 
     * 
     * The next part of this block might be a little intimidating for students who are not super comfortable with scripting languages. I would run through the logic or the possible solution with a group who is very keen, if you have time at the end of the class.

    // str_word_count() -> This can do a couple of things, including taking a string and returning the number of words in it ($text, 0) or taking a string and returning an array where each item is a word ($text, 1). We are doing the latter.

     * Now, we've got to check two things:
